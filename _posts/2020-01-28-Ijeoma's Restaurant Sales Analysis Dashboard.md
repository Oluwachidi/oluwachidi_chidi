<h4 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h4>
<p>In conclusion we are able to determine that the ideal target
customer is most likely a male between the ages of 26 39 years
of age and is likely a subscriber and we can see that the busiest
days for rentals are Tuesdays and Wednesdays, although any day
during the week has a higher likelihood of rental than compared
to weekends. We can also see that stations along the shore are
much busier than stations located inland. We can also determine
that the usage is much higher on the San Francisco side of the
Golden Gate bridge, as opposed to Oakland.</p>
