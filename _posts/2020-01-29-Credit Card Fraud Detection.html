<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.</p>
<p>This notebook is designed to enable credit card companies to detect fraudulent transactions.</p>




<h2 class="section-heading">Rebalancing Dataset</h2>
<p>This dataset contains 284,807 transactions,out of which 492 belong to fraudulent transactions, 
  which represents 0.17% of overall transactions. There are 31 columns in the data, one being 
  called “Class” which is the target variable having the value of 1 being “Fraud” and zero means “Norma</p>

<p>☝️ in this `fraud detection` project, **the classes are extremely imbalanced**:</p>
<ul>
  <li>99.8 % of normal transactions</li>
  <li>0.2 % of fraudulent transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>We won't be able to detect frauds unless we apply some serious rebalancing strategies! This was achived in two steps:</p>
<p>First, I create three separate Train/Val/Test splits from the dataset. It is extremely important to keep validation and 
  testing sets not rebalanced so as to evaluate your model in true conditions without data leak.</p>
<code>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)</code>
<code>X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.3)</code>

<p>Second, I rebalance the training set by use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) to generate new datapoints by weighting the existing ones 
  and  RandomUnderSampler to downsample a little bit the majority class</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Model Iteration</h2>
<p>Having rebalanced the dataset, I apply a Neural Network of over 1,700 parameters to optimize the test score and score the model on the unseen test set</p>
<p>Compute the confusion matrix and classification report on the test set</p>
