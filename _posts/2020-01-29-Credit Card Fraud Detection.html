<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.</p>
<p>This notebook is designed to enable credit card companies to detect fraudulent transactions.</p>



<h2 class="section-heading">Rebalancing Dataset</h2>
<p>This dataset contains 284,807 transactions,out of which 492 belong to fraudulent transactions, 
  which represents 0.17% of overall transactions. There are 31 columns in the data, one being 
  called “Class” which is the target variable having the value of 1 being “Fraud” and zero means “Norma</p>
<code>#Let's check class balance
pd.Series(y).value_counts()</code>

<p>☝️ in this `fraud detection` project, **the classes are extremely imbalanced**:</p>
<ul>
  <li>99.8 % of normal transactions</li>
  <li>0.2 % of fraudulent transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>We won't be able to detect frauds unless we apply some serious rebalancing strategies!</p>
